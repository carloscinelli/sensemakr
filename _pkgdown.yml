- title: Main function and methods (sensemakr)
  desc: >
    Here you will find the main functions of the `sensemakr` package.
    These functions will likely suffice for most users, for most of the time.
    The main workflow consists of fitting a linear model with `lm()` and
    running the sensitivity analysis with `sensemakr()`. This function returns
    an object of class sensemakr with all main sensitivity results, which one can then explore
    the results with the print, plot and summary methods.

- title: Sensitivity statistics
  desc: >
    These functions compute sensitivity statistics suited for routine reporting in regression table.
    For example, the `robustness_value()` computes the minimial strength of association that unobserved variables
    would need to have, *both* with the treatment, and with the outcome, to explain away the observed effect.
    The `partial_r2()` of the treatment with the outcome computes the minimal strength of association
    unobserved variables would need to have with the treatment to explain away the effect, even if they explained
    all residual variation of the outcome.

    These functions provide direct access to sensitivity contour plots and extreme sensitivity plots for customization.

- title: Bias, adjusted estimates and standard errors
  desc: >
    Given a pair of partial R2 values that describes unobsverd confounders,
    these functions compute the bias, adjusted estimate, adjusted standard errors,
    and other statistics that one would have obtained in the regression that includes
    a confounder with such stregth.
  contents:

- title: Bounds on confounding
  desc: >
    Functions for computing bounds on the maximum strength of unobserved
    confounding by means of comparison with the explanatory power of observed covariates.
