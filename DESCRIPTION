Authors@R: c(person("Chad", "Hazlett", email = "chazlett@ucla.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person("Carlos", "Cinelli", email = "carloscinelli@ucla.edu", role = c("aut")),

Description: Practitioners of causal inference have a wide variety of tools to assess the influence of observed confounders on their effect estimates. sensemakr makes it easy to assess the influence of unobserved confounders, bound effect estimates, and visually plot confounding. 
   The package defines a custom 'sensemakr' class with plot and print methods, as well as allowing users to directly specify models or data to plot.
