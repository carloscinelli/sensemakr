#### Darfur Data ####

##' The Darfur Dataset
##' @description  Data on attitudes of Darfurian refugees in eastern Chad.
##' Key ``treatment'' variable is directharm, which indicates that individual
##' was physically injured during attacks on villages in Darfur, largely between
##' 2003 and 2004. Hazlett (2017) argues that conditional on gender and village
##' who is injured is effectively random.  This is because injury was caused by either
##' indiscriminate bombing, or by militia. The latter are thought to have used violence
##' indiscriminately as well, with the purpose of driving the population out, not
##' targeting individuals of a particular type. Key covariates that are sure to be
##' pre-treatment include herder_dar (whether they were a herder in Darfur),
##' farmer_dar (whether they were a farmer in Darfur), age, female (indicator for female),
##' and past_voted (whether they vote in an earlier election, prior to the conflict.)
